//What the HECK is a DTO? Data Transfer Object. A DTO is just a model of /some/ data coming from the client
//An HTTP handler will parse a JSON object sent by the user, containing their username and password
//this then gets sent to the controller to get turned into a Java object
//The username and password will be put into the DTO as fields, which will then get checked/validated by the service layer
//You NEVER store a DTO in the database. It's purely for Data Transfer... hence Data Transfer Object
